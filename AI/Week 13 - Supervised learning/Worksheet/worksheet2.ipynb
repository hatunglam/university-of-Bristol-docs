    "# The naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture notes that the naive Bayes classifier works as follows. We are trying to approximate an unknown function $$f:V \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}$$\n",
    "where $V$ is our feature space and our output space $\\mathcal{O} = \\{c_1, c_2, ... c_K\\}$ is a finite set of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive Bayes classifier does this by building a model that assigns the class label $\\hat{y} = c_k$ as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\text{argmax}_k p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "that is, the $k$ that maximises this quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, multiplying all the $p(x_i| c_k)$ together is going to give some very small values. Therefore, we take the log to make it easier to compute; this is a common trick, since, for positive arguments, the log is a monotonically increasing function the $\\text{argmax}_x f(x)=\\text{argmax}_x \\log{f(x)}$.\n",
    "                                \\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{y} &= \\text{argmax}_k p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k)= \\text{argmax}_k \\log\\left[p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k)\\right]\\\\\n",
    "&=\\text{argmax}_k \\left[\\log{p(c_k)} + \\sum_i \\log{p(x_i|c_k)}\\right]\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose that $p(x_i|c_k)$ is given by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_k$ and variance $\\sigma_k^2$, then we obtain the following expression:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{y} &= \\text{argmax}_k \\left[ \\log{p(c_k)} + \\sum_i \\log{p(x_i|c_k)} \\right] \\\\\n",
    "&= \\text{argmax}_k \\left[ \\log{p(c_k)} + \\sum_i \\log{\\frac{1}{\\sigma_k\\sqrt{2\\pi}}}\\exp{\\left( - \\frac{(x_i-\\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma_k^2}\\right)} \\right] \\\\\n",
    "&= \\text{argmax}_k \\left[ \\log{p(c_k)} - \\sum_i \\log{\\left(\\sigma_k\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\right)} - \\sum_i \\frac{(x_i-\\mu_k)^2}{2\\sigma_k^2} \\right] \\quad \\text{log-likelihood.}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "Expressing the values in terms of these sums means that they do not get so small, and it is less likely that there will be errors at the machine precision level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we implement this in practice? We assume that each probability $p(x_i| c_k)$ is given by some distribution, and then given a datapoint $\\vec{x}$, we plug the value into the equation for the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question you will: \n",
    "    (a) (Optional) implement your own version of the Gaussian naive Bayes classifier, \n",
    "    (b) (Optional) check your classifier against the implementation in sci-kit learn, \n",
    "    (c) compare the accuracy of the scikit-learn naive Bayes classifier with the accuracy of the k-nearest neighbours classifier, and \n",
    "    (d) run cross-validation to verify whether the kNN classfier or the Gaussian naive Bayes classifier performs better on this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## (Optional) Part (a) Implementing Gaussian naive Bayes\n",
    "For this question we will make the assumption that each feature is described by a normal (also called Gaussian) distribution. The procedure is as follows:\n",
    "1. Divide the training data by class\n",
    "2. Calculate mean and standard deviation per class and per feature\n",
    "4. For each datapoint in the validation set, calculate the log-likelihood for each class and for each feature (Hint: use the function `scipy.stats.norm.logpdf`)\n",
